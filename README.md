# Pokemon Netbattle
This is a C# reimplementation of the [Pokemon Netbattle](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_NetBattle) game.

# Why?
This is part of a project of mine to port the old game to a newer language.

Netbattle was a big part of my life for quite a few years. I still have the original codebase lying around, and figured I could give it some justice by bringing it to the open source world, and give myself a programming challenge to port it.
