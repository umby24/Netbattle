'// Purpose  : To create file associations with default icons

'// Improved 23/1/200 - New parameters 'Switch', 'PromptOnError', better error handling

'// Parameters
'// Required    Extension       (Str) ie ".exe"
'// Required    FileType        (Str) ie "VB.Form"
'// Required    FileTYpeName    (Str) ie. "Visual Basic Form"
'// Required    Action          (Str) ie. "Open" or "Edit"
'// Required    AppPath         (Str) ie. "C:\Myapp"
'// Optional    Switch          (Str) ie. "/u"                  Default = ""

'// Optional    PromptOnError   (Bol)                           Default = False

'// HOW IT WORKS

'// "DefaultIcon"     Default = DefaultIcon(Str)
'// "shell"
